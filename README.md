# clip
The clip CSS property defines what portion of an element is visible. The clip property applies only to absolutely positioned elements, that is elements with position:absolute or position:fixed .

values descript a top/left point and bottom/right point

# clip-path
The clip-path property in CSS allows you to specify a specific region of an element to display, rather than showing the complete area.

clip-path: inset(10px 20px 30px 40px);

# To Create a new Repository on GitHub:
##### First of all why we create repositories of github?
**Ans:** You can store a variety of projects in GitHub repositories, including open source projects. With open source projects, you can share code to make better, more reliable software.
To put your project up on GitHub, you'll need to create a repository for it to live in.

## Steps to create a Repository on GitHub:
1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the + drop-down menu, and select New repository.
2. Type a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".
3. Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."
4. Choose a repository visbility. For more information, see "[About repository visibility.](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repository-visibility)"
5. Select Initialize this repository with a **README**.
6. Click Create repository.

Congratulations! You've successfully created your first repository, and initialized it with a *README* file.

# Correction in Faheem's learning about github pages
- You don't have to update your link, when you push your code github pages link automatically updated by its own.
- Put your github pages in your repo's description, this will me more easy to navigate to the page.
